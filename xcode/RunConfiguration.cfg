# Name of the executable to launch from the build products directory.
# Common options: pascal, pscalvm, pscald, pscaljson2bc, dascal,
# clike, clike-repl, or rea.

# a typical shell: use quotes to group whitespace and backslashes to
# escape characters.  Specify additional "args" lines to append more
# segments to the command line.

# Working directory for the launched process.  Relative paths are
# resolved against this file's location.  The default changes to the
# repository root so binaries can locate bundled data files.
