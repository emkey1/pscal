# Agent Notes

## Repository Context
- Runtime and front ends live under `src/`; unit tests under `Tests/`; executables build to `build/bin/` via CMake.
- Pascal/REA compiler logic is concentrated in `src/compiler/compiler.c`; many globals track compile state, so save/restore helpers are common.
- Beware Dropbox sync conflicts: `git add` may require escalated permissions; `.git/index.lock` errors usually just mean rerun with elevation.

## Build & Test
- Configure with `cmake -S . -B build [-DSDL=ON] [-DBUILD_DASCAL=ON]`, then `cmake --build build`.
- Use `Tests/run_all_tests`; set `RUN_SDL=1` or `RUN_NET_TESTS=1` as needed. Prefer targeted scripts in `Tests/` for quicker iteration.
- Library conformance lives under `Tests/libs/`. Each front end has its own harness; the Rea suite (`Tests/libs/rea/run_tests.py`) spins up an HTTP helper, inspects optional extended built-ins (yyjson, etc.), and exports `REA_TEST_EXT_BUILTINS`/`REA_TEST_HAS_YYJSON` so JSON checks are skipped when support is absent.
- Scope validation suites live in `Tests/scope_verify/` (`clike`, `pascal`, `rea`). The harnesses are manifest-driven and support `--only`, `--list`, `--seed`, and `--cmd` overrides. Rea's runner (`Tests/scope_verify/rea/rea_scope_test_harness.py`) materialises fixtures via `--update` and records reports under `Tests/scope_verify/rea/out/`.
- Test manifests (e.g., `Tests/scope_verify/rea/tests/manifest.json`) are generated through the corresponding `build_manifest.py`; regenerate them when adding or editing cases to keep fixtures in sync.

## Coding Practices
- C11 style: 4-space indent, braces on same line, camelCase for functions, uppercase snake for macros.
- Many compiler helpers rely on implicit global state; when adding new stacks (like the vtable tracker), ensure push/pop happen on every exit path.
- Keep allocations paired with frees; leak auditors assume matcher functions like `freeVTableClassList` exist.
- When adding VM builtins, append them to the end of the dispatch tables/registration arrays so legacy builtin IDs remain stable.

## Workflow Tips
- Always read existing globals before introducing new onesâ€”regressions often come from missing reset logic during module/unit compiles.
- Tests are slow; when editing the compiler, run at least the relevant front-end suite prior to broader sweeps.
- Document any env vars you touch (`SDL_VIDEODRIVER`, `RUN_SDL`, etc.) in commits/PRs; future agents look here for quick bootstrapping.
